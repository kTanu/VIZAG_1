        <h2 style="color: #33090d"> Welcom Cafe Oceanic </h2>
            <p style="color:#1f1d0e;font-size: 20px;">ITC is already a pioneer in the catering industry so it’s no surprise that the buffet at Welcome Cafe Oceanic is known as the ‘Rolls Royce of Buffets’ in Vizag. An all-day lounge restaurant located with the pool in its backdrop, this place has the prettiest view of the sea. The restaurant is very prettily decorated, has the most courteous staff and the best Asian food in the city. When in Vizag, make sure you definitely visit this fab place for tantalizing flavours and delish cuisines. </p>

                <h2 style="color: #33090d"> Lawson’s Lounge</h2>
                    <p style="color: #1f1d0e;font-size: 20px;">Romantic dinner date, high-class business meeting, club hang outs and relaxed celebratory parties - all apt reasons to visit Taj Gateway’s stunning Lawson’s Lounge. A restaurant-cum-bar-cum-lounge, this is an eatery with the warmest ambience and its very own sea deck. So grab some scrumptious finger food, a glass of bubbles, head on to that deck and clink to the perfect sunset.</p>

                        <h2 style="color: #33090d">Percolator Coffee House</h2>
                            <p style="color: #1f1d0e;font-size: 20px;">Coffee, biryani and ice cream - three things that perhaps we could literally gorge on all the time in life, ain't this true? To make that ice cream a fabulous Sunday, have it at Percolator, a relaxed place with the best ambience located near the sea for a dreamy view of the water. A true local favourite for all Vizag residents, this is perhaps the best cafe in the city and serves all cafe food such as pizza, burgers, fries, chilli vegetables and more.</p>

                                <h2 style="color: #33090d">Shack</h2>
                                    <p style="color: #1f1d0e;font-size: 20px;">When the Shack opened, it was touted to be a driver for the Goa-fication of Vizag as the former is popular for similar food and drink shacks present on the beach. But thankfully Vizag did not become the next Goa and retained its sea-town charm by restricting more shacks making this one a truly unique eatery in the city. Located within the Park Hotel, the Shack serves great Moroccan and Seafood with dreamy pints of cold beer, right on the beach. </p>
